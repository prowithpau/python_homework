Homework: Python Refresher - Casting, Loops, Modulo, Conditionals & If-Else-Statements

Rules:
- Write plain Python (no imports, no functions)
- Fill in the code after each task
- Keep variable names in snake_case

Tips:
- Run the script often to test your work
- Shortcut in VSC to run Python: Ctrl - F5
- If it doesn’t work, you can assign your own shortcut:
  Ctrl + K Ctrl + S → Search "Python: Run Python File in Terminal" → Set Keybinding

# Exercise 1
# Create a string position = "12.00"
# Cast it to int and print the result and its type


# Exercise 2
# Print numbers from 0 to 4 (including 4)
# Print only even numbers from 2 to 10 (excluding 10) using step-size


# Exercise 3
# Start with value = 1
# Divide it by 2 repeatedly (use an augmented assignment operator)
# Stop when value is smaller than 0.05
# Print each intermediate value


# Exercise 4
# Suppose we are scheduling tasks over days of the week (7 days)
# For task numbers from 1 to 14, print: "Task X → Day Y"
# Use modulo (%) to map task numbers to day numbers (1–7)


# Exercise 5
# Create variables hours_worked = 5, is_weekend = True, tasks_done = 5
# Print "Take a break" if hours_worked > 3, or if hours_worked > 2 and tasks_done > 1, or if is_weekend or if tasks_done > 2
# Otherwise print "Keep going, you got this!"


# Exercise 6
# Create variable score = 72
# If the score is lower than 50 print "Fail"
# Otherwise, if the score is between 50 and 75 print "Pass"
# Otherwise print "Excellent"
